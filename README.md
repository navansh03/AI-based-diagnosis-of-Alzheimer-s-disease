# AI-based Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease

This repository aims to leverage Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques to assist in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The project primarily utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis, model building, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that impacts memory and other cognitive functions. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for patient care and treatment planning. This project explores AI-based methodologies to automate and enhance the diagnostic process using clinical and/or imaging datasets.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
- Application of various machine learning algorithms for classification and prediction
- Model evaluation and performance comparison
- Visualization of results and insights
- Modular and reproducible Jupyter Notebook workflows

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Common data science libraries (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/navansh03/AI-based-diagnosis-of-Alzheimer-s-disease.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AI-based-diagnosis-of-Alzheimer-s-disease
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (If a `requirements.txt` file is not present, manually install the necessary libraries.)

### Usage

- Open the main Jupyter Notebook file(s) in your local environment or in Google Colab.
- Follow the step-by-step instructions and code cells for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Modify the code as needed for experimentation or to use your own dataset.

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/` - Contains all Jupyter Notebook files for data analysis and model development.
